# React-Image-Slider
A simple image slider using React.js and Animate.css  
  
/public - Slider Images and HTML  
/src - Review the code  
  
If you wish to run this in your own development environment, install webpack and use the package.json to install the node.js modules required.  I am not using everything in this webpack, it's just my boilerplate. Feel free to trim/modify it if you have your own.  
  
```  
npm install --save-dev webpack  
npm start  
```    
  
/build - An optimized production code demo.  
  
```    
npm install -g pushstate-server  
pushstate-serever buildstart http://localhost:9000  
```
